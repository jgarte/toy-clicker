  <h4>What is virtual reality?</h4>
  <p>
      Virtual reality is a way of fooling the senses to believe that a different reality is true.
      In it's simplest form it can even be watching ASMR videos with your eyes closed, feeling like you are in a different place due to the audio-sensory input while lacking visual stimuli that contrasts.
      More advanced virtual reality systems include headsets and headphones that project images and noises of a different world.

    <p>
        Virtual reality combined with sex toys can transport the user to different worlds and increase the effect of sex toy usage by fooling the brain into thinking they are in a different scenario.
