  <h4>What is vibrating?</h4>
  <p>
      Vibration is the rapid oscillation of a device, in this case one used to stimulate the user's genitals.
      More advanced sex toys have further controls over the vibration, such as controlling how severe the vibrations are or altering the pattern of vibration.
      Some toys may have multiple separate vibrating components that allow the user to feel different sensations along different parts of the toy.
