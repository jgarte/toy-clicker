  <h4>What is internet connectivity?</h4>
  <p>
      As part of the modern, interconnected age, many "dumb" devices are being superseded by ones which can connect to the internet in some way.

  <h4>What does connectivity allow?</h4>
  <p>
      Connectivity can allow for data mining and analytics, so you can see how often you use your sex toy and for how long you use it.
      It may also allow for remote presence, where someone else can control the sex toy or you can control anothers.
      Some remote presence sex toys are connected over the internet, so as one person uses it, the other person feels changes through their sex toy.

    <h4>What are the risks of connectivity?</h4>
    <p>
        While connectivity feels like a good idea, unless the devices (and their online platforms) are properly secured, you can have data leaks.
        This can mean people find out you have a particular sex toy or discover how often you use, it or even can control it without your permission.
        While the former shouldn't be an issue, in a society where sexuality is still often taboo it can make one a pariah, and even in a more accepting society privacy should still be a reasonable expectation.
