<p class="lead">Why are we making sex toys?</p>

<p>
    The year is 69AH (After Horny), 69 years after being horny was made illegal.
</p>
<p>
    The anti-horny laws have been overturned and you decide to open a sex shop to take advantage of the world's new-found horniness.

<h5><b>Workbench</b></h5>

<p>
    Your work bench is where you make your artisanal sex toys, and there is always demand for them since they were illegal for so long.
</p>

<h5><b>Buildings</b></h5>
<p>
    As you grow bigger, you can rent/buy different buildings where you can hire staff (see HR) who will make sex toys for you.
</p>

<h5><b>HR</b></h5>
<p>
    You can hire staff to make sex toys for you, but they need to have the right buildings available for them to work in.
</p>

<h5><b>Research</b></h5>
<p>
    As you make more sex toys you unlock the ability to do research into new additions to sex toys and create more exciting devices.
</p>

<h5><b>Upgrades</b></h5>
<p>
    You can spend money to upgrade your buildings, your workbench, or your staff and their amenities to improve the production of sex toys and become the greatest sex toy distributor the world has ever seen.
