<p class="lead">You discovered new materials to make sex toys from!</p>

<section data-min-level="1">
  <h4>Why is this important?</h4>
  <p>
      Older sex toys are made from materials that are rougher, more likely to break/splinter, or are harder to clean.
      Researching newer materials allows for new levels of safety, comfort, and hygiene to exist.

  <h4>What sort of materials?</h4>
  <p>
      Advancements in material science allows us to use everything from well-formed glass or pyrex to metal, silicone, or latex.
      Some materials have inbuilt anti-microbial/anti-bacterial properties, however this is only a guide and proper cleaning is still important.
      Other materials have different specific heat capacities and thus can feel much colder or warmer quite easily, allowing for sensation play.
